# CMDA-Data-Competition-Fall-2023
Developers: Rowan Muhoberac, Quinlan Brennan

This repository contains all code utilized in modeling our dataset, as well as projecting a local webserver that can accept responses.

AI Test Tree: This class contains the implementation of the model and is ran against the full test set of data.

insurance_app: This class contains the model, and integrates it into an easily callable function. It then launches a dev server using FLASK.

Index: HTML file that contains formatting for the simple UI used for the test server and actual implementation

raw.csv: Contains the modified dataset for use in processing.

Note: The actual project is hosted on pythonanywhere.com, great site I highly recommend for quick and easy integration
